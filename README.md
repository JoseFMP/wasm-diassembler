# Quick information
This is an NPM library that is capable to disassembly webassemblies binaries.
It is based on typescript and is targeting to be high-performance and minimalistic
in the amount of dependencies.

To install it just issue:
```
npm install wasm-disassembler
```

To disassemble a WASM binary:
```
    const binaryProvider = new WasmMemoryProvider(binary)
    const disassembler = new WasmDisassembler(binaryProvider)
    const disassembly = await disassembler.Parse()
```
where `binary` is a `Uint8Array` type.
Note that you can implement your own binary provider besides the already existing `WasmMemoryProvider`. For that purpose you just need to implement the `WasmBinaryProvider` interface.
